# todolist made with localStorage

in this project I'm working on making a todo list with JavaScript in the browser.
So I am trying to use the localStorage to list my todo elements.
Still figuring out, how I will get it out of localStorage in a decent way
and how I will style it.

## Why am I doing this?
Just because I want to.
I don't even think, I'll ever use it. But it's worth the effort to me.

## it is a work in progress
- I found a way to get the todolist string in the localStorage
- Still looking for a way to get it out and on to the webpage decently. 
- I got it out to the page, but there now is a problem with removing a paragraph because
I add buttons after the page has rendered. this method clearly doesn't work.
- I think I'll work with array primarily and only save to localStorage when I want to close the page. (15/02/26)
